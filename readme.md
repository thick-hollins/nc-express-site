# React front-end: nc-express 

This project is a Reddit-like web-app allowing a user to view and post articles and comments, and to up- and down-vote other user's contributions. It uses React to handle navigation and interaction between various site-areas as a single page app. The content is served from my [backend project](https://github.com/thick-hollins/nc-express)
